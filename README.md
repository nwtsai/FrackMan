# FrackMan
A video game based on the old arcade game 'Dig Dug' | Developed with C++

# Description
‣ The object of the game is to find all hidden Oil Barrel objects and proceed to the next level without getting caught by the AI, also known as the Protesters. <br />

‣ The Regular Protesters (in dark blue) only follow the player when you, the Frackman (holding a pickaxe), are in their line of sight. <br />

‣ The Hardcore Protesters (in overalls) calculate your current location during every tick of the game and derive the shortest possible path towards you. <br />

‣ Everytime a Protester comes close to your location, you will lose health. Once your health drops to 0%, you lose the game. <br />
